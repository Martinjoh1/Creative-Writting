# Motivation
I am building this program in order to make typing a more creative and fun experience.
I hope to build a progrma that allows people to type a word, and then make that word artistically using the trutle. 
There should be different colors, and letters should be filled, the users should be able to input a word, and colors, and than 
their word should be given with their specified colors. It should be fun, and interesting, and the person should want to come back for more. 

# purpose
Build  a progamr that makes word art. 

## Initial Design Plan


Class name: Word
Class Attributes:  Turtle class


Class Collaborations (other classes):
Self.draw	# gives instructions for drawing each letter
Self.Color 	# allows turtle to take in different colors when drawing the letters
Self.x		#gives starting x positon for the letters
Sel.y 		#gives starting y position for the lettes
  


Class Methods: 

Class Collaborations (other classes):
Turtle class 

__int__():
Draws the letter starting in the (x,y position which stays the same)

User_input_color ():
Takes in the users word input for color

User_input_ Word():
Takes in the users word input

letter Dictionary ():
Creates a dictionary that connects each word to a number

Word_draw():
Draws the word based on the input given by the user, and the using the letter dictionary to design the word

Word_export(): 
Sends the word to a seperate file, for the user to print it off and use it. 

  





# Files
T03 (This helps to use turtles artistically)
T13 (This will help me set up the class)
T14 (helps set up letter dictionary)
T10 (Helps to positon turtles)
T02 (Helps in basic uderstanding and use of turtles)
T06 (Artistic use of turtles)
T07 (Artistic use of turtles)
A03 (positioning, and use of turtles)
A02 (use of turtles)
A08 (Helps wo make the letter dictionary, which helps to make the words)


Summary
You'll complete this part at the end of the project. Provide a brief summary description of the design and implementation, including how much your initial design plan evolved, the final result you achieved and the amount of time you spent as a programmer in accomplishing these results, including any challenges overcome and innovations that were not specifically required by the assignment. This should be no more than three paragraphs.

Video
You'll complete this part at the end of the project. In this section, add a publicly available link to a YouTube video which you will create, demonstrating how to use your program. The video is a short (less than 5 minutes) demonstration video. Your video should include:

A title screen, including the class name, your name, and the project title
You briefly discussing your project and it's motivation
A demonstration on how to use the program, much like a marketing video.
A short discussion about what you learned through the process of building the program.
DO NOT include a section where you scroll through the code. Your video should include NO code.
A credits roll
Instructions
Explain how to use your program and/or play your game.

Errors
You'll complete this part at the end of the project. Every program has bugs. Use this section to create a bullet list of all known errors and deficiencies that remain in your code.

Reflection
You'll complete this part at the end of the project. Write a paragraph or two of your reactions to the final project.

References
Throughout this project, you've likely used outside resources. Reference all ideas or code which are not your own, and describe and how you integrated the ideas or code into your program. This includes online sources, people who have helped you, and any other resources that are not solely your own contribution.

A Note From Scott to You
While there seems like a lot of work around this final project, one thing to keep in mind is HAVE FUN with it! You are creating code to express your interests. Make a fun video. Break up the writing so itâ€™s not so burdensome. We will have a live demo session on our last day of class. It'll be the most fun final exam you've ever had!
